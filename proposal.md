# Major Project Proposal for Computer Science 30

This project is based off the 4X grand strategy game called "Stellaris". Stellaris's gameplay revolves around space exploration, managing an empire, and diplomacy and warfare with other spacefaring civilizations. However, the most simple of these systems is the empire management one, and I've decided to create a game based around this system.
